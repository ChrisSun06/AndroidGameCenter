#What we should do!
I will get my allotted work done on time.
I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.
Should an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team meeting, I will notify my team immediately.
The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
I will help my team to understand every concept in the project.
If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask my team for help.
